			<b><span class='content_title'><a href='/archive/16-pc-mobile-game-projects-archived'>PC & Mobile Game Projects (Archived)</a></span></b><pre class='pre_content'>I also have other software projects that I have never mentioned on my website. I developed some PC & Mobile games and published them on the internet. In 2015 and 2016, I started 3 game projects. I completed and released the first two projects and I canceled the last one to have a better work-life balance. I was also working at a full-time job.

In my games, I used various graphical content that belonged to me and some professional artists. The games partially contained paid and free drawings, music, and sound effects. Personally, I draw pictures as a hobby. But it takes so much time and people have high expectations for video games today. I never had that much free time and I personally find that putting too much effort and time into just a single game is too risky. I never worked for more than one month on a game project.


<b>Cancelled 3D Mobile Game</b>
<img src="/storage/content/16/seagame.gif" width="499px" height="373px">

The game actually had no name. In 2016, I decided to make a 3D mobile game with Unity Game Engine and I worked on this project for a while and I cancelled it to have a better work-life balance. Additionally, mobile market profit was dropping, there were so many mobile games, and whatever you do, it was almost impossible to reach potential customers without paying lots of advertisement money.

The game was taking place at sea. In the game, two men were kidnapping and putting the main character into a boat while the main character was unconscious. He was awakening in the middle of nowhere at sea while the weather was stormy. The aim was to stay alive until reaching the shore. The character was fishing to eat, collecting rainwater, and boiling seawater to make it drinkable. Pure water is harmful. So, there were punishment and treatment mechanisms in the game. The character was catching useful objects that were floating on the sea. By using wood he was setting fire. He was cooking food and boiling water. There was a minigame to keep the boat balanced while the weather was stormy. Also, the environment was affecting the psychology of the main character. If the main character's mental health was going bad, he was seeing hallucinations.

I planned to add 5 different biomes to the game. (Normal, cold, tropical seas, swamps, and a magical sea belonged to the protagonist's hallucinations, etc.) I also planned to add lots of sea creatures as well. I only worked on the first biome and I cancelled the project.


<b>Marwin and The Evolution Stone [PC Game (Windows)]</b>
<img src="/storage/content/16/marwin_banner.png">
It was kind of a different 2D game. I made it in 2016. There were two main characters in the game (A whale named "Marwin" and a monkey). The monkey was actually a human. A dark wizard turned into him a monkey by using the evolution stone. The whale was helping him to get the evolution stone to make him a human again. According to Evolution Theory, humans are actually the descendants of apes. But this was just an imaginary comedy, platformer game that was developed for everyone. It also included wizards, magic, etc.

It was a game with a story. There were 50 levels in the game. Additionally, a local 2-player level and a survival level were also included. The game had so many different kinds of places like forests, deserts, snowy, creepy, and magical places. There were also other animal game characters (Hippo, elephant, etc.) who joined the journey. They were heavier than the monkey and they were making the game more challenging.

I completed the development of the game in a month. I partially drew, designed, and used licensed graphical content. I used various licensed music and sound effects.

<b>Mission Calculus - The Lost Planet: Derivaton [Mobile Game (Android, IOS)]</b>
<img src="/storage/content/16/mission_calculus_icon.png">

In 2015, I decided to make a mobile game about mathematics with Unity Game Engine. It was an educational game about calculus. There were 100 questions covering functions, inverse functions, trigonometric functions, exponentials, logarithmic functions, rate of change, limit, derivatives, and integrals.

There was a story that took place in a traveling spaceship. The ship captain was going after the lost planet, Derivaton. He was solving calculus questions to hack the enemy spaceship's firewall and turn off their shield to hit them with laser gun.

I released this game on various mobile stores in 2015. I partially made the game with licensed graphical content. I also used various musicians' licensed music in the game. I removed the game after it became outdated.
